\section{Project Assignment}
\subsection{Context}
Spienzer B.V. operates at the intersection of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and SEA (Search Engine Advertising), providing innovative tools for webpage’s content workflow automation, position ranking, and advertising optimization. With a focus on leveraging AI for content generation, the company seeks to enhance the visibility and performance of client websites on search engines. Currently, Spienzer B.V. employs a small team, with the majority in the IT department, serving businesses aiming for improved Google search rankings.
\subsection{Goal of the Project}
The main challenge for website owners is identifying which webpages to optimize first due to a lack of clear, actionable data. Current methods do not provide an easy way to see the actual visitor numbers per page compared to their potential traffic, making it difficult to prioritize optimization efforts effectively. This can result in missed opportunities for increasing webpage visibility and engagement.\\

Our solution aims to address this by offering a straightforward tool for website owners to compare current visitor statistics against potential traffic. This allows for targeted optimizations where needed, ensuring resources are efficiently used to enhance webpage performance and reach.
\subsection{The Assignment}
The assignment involves creating a robust integration system with Google Analytics to correlate various data points (Search Engine Results Page (SERP) position and search volume) with web traffic data, developing a frontend and backend analytics functionality for overall and per-page analysis, formulating a priority ranking algorithm for pages necessitating modifications and formulating an algorithm for web traffic predictions.
\subsection{Initial Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does the position on SERP correlate with web traffic, particularly in terms of click-through rates (CTR) for different positions?
    \item What methodologies can be developed to prioritize webpages needing modifications based on SEO data?
    \item What criteria should be used to formulate a priority ranking algorithm for webpages that need optimization?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Preconditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access to Spienzer's current analytics systems, software development tools, and platforms for the integration and analytics functionality.
    \item Effective supervision and support from the IT department.
    \item Workspace equipped with necessary technology and resources for successful project execution.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Approach}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sprint Planning:} Define user stories, tasks, and estimates for each development cycle (sprint).
    \item \textbf{Weekly Scrum Meetings:} Weekly meetings with a duration of at least an hour to discuss progress, identify obstacles, and adapt the plan.
    \item \textbf{Sprint Reviews:} Demonstrate completed work and gather feedback for improvement.
    \item \textbf{Sprint Retrospectives:} Evaluate the sprint, identify areas for improvement, and adapt the process for future iterations.
\end{itemize}
This Agile Scrum methodology will ensure continuous development, collaboration, and adaptation throughout the project lifecycle.
\subsection{Technological Stack}
The technological stack that has already been used within the Spienzer project should be leveraged, which is: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Version control:} GitLab
    \item \textbf{Project management tool:} Jira Software
    \item \textbf{Microservices deployment, Database deployment, Cloud computing, Event-driven queueing:} Google Cloud
    \item \textbf{Backend:} Python programming language
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} Vue.js framework
    \item \textbf{Database management system:} PostgreSQL
    \item \textbf{REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface):} FastAPI and Flask frameworks
    \item \textbf{Wireframes design tool:} Figma Software
\end{itemize}
Additionally, \textbf{Google Analytics API} is to be utilized and \textbf{UML (Unified Modeling Language)} is to be used for Analysis and Design artefacts.

\subsection{Risk Management}

Key risks for the project are identified and straightforward strategies are outlined below to address them:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Integrity Risk:} Inaccurate analytics data might lead to incorrect SEO/SEA decisions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Implement routine data accuracy checks and error-detection mechanisms.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Search Engine Algorithm Updates:} SEO strategies could be impacted by unforeseen algorithm changes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Regularly update SEO practices to align with the latest search engine guidelines.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Authentication and Authorization:} Required permissions, accounts, and credentials must be obtained in a timely manner to ensure access to necessary resources. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Requests for these have been made early on, with regular follow-ups to ensure their timely arrival.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Compatibility:} New functionalities might not integrate seamlessly with existing technologies.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Perform early compatibility testing and use containerization for incompatible components.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Health Risk:} Health issues could impact project staffing and timelines.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Promote a healthy work environment and well-executed time management for emergencies.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Missing Deadlines Risk:} Failing to meet project milestones could lead to delays and increased costs.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Implement a robust project management framework, regularly review progress, and adjust timelines as needed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In the table below each risk is assessed, based on its likelihood and impact (Low, Medium or High). 

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Likelihood} & \textbf{Impact} \\ \hline
Data Integrity & Medium & High \\ \hline
SEO Algorithm Updates & Medium & Medium \\ \hline
Authorization & Low & High \\ \hline
Compatibility & Medium & Medium \\ \hline
Health Risk & Low & High \\ \hline
Missing Deadlines & Low & High \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Risk Assessment}
\label{table:risk_management}
\end{table}

Risks will be continuously monitored and mitigations adjusted as necessary to ensure the project remains on course.
